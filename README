Changes made to the model since previous homework:

 - was getting a NullPointerException in my validDeck method, changed the way I checked to throw
 exceptions in the first 2 lines of the method

- made fields private in BasicKlondike

- made fields protected in Pile

- added java doc for constructors and classes

- created helpers to simplify isGameOver in BasicKlondike

 - changed methods in Draw class to package private instead of public

 - made helpers like isPileEmpty(), movePileToEmpty(), isKing(), and isAce() to make move methods more readable and cut out duplicate code

- changes isGameOver to check if thereâ€™s any possible moves, or if every cascade is empty, made helpers to do so

- made an abstract class, AbstractKlondike which implements KlondikeModel

- made BasicKlondike, LimitedDrawKlondike, and WhiteheadKlondike extend AbstractKlondike

- made a new abstract class AbstractCascade which extends Pile

- made a new class WhiteheadCascade to represent cascades where all the cards are visible

- made WhiteheadCascade and Cascade extend AbstractCascade
